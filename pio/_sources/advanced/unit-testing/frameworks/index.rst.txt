Testing Frameworks
------------------

PIO supports the most popular testing frameworks and allows you to
easily switch between them using the :ref:`projectconf_test_framework`
option in :ref:`projectconf`.

You can mix different frameworks in the same project. For example, use a
more advanced C++ testing framework with Mocks for the :ref:`platform_native`
development platform to run desktop tests on a host machine and a lightweight
framework, such as :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_unity`, for running tests on the
target embedded device with constrained resources.

**Compatibility**

  * - Framework
    - :ref:`unit_testing_runner_test_types`
    - :ref:`platforms`
    - Mocking

  * - :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_doctest`
    - Native
    - :ref:`platform_native`
    - No

  * - :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_googletest`
    - Any
    - :ref:`platform_native`, :ref:`platform_espressif8266`,
      :ref:`platform_espressif32`
    - Yes

  * - :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_unity`
    - Any
    - Any
    - No

.. tip::

  We highly recommend using the :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_unity` testing
  framework if you plan to run tests on the target devices with constrained
  resources. The :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_unity` has minimal requirements
  and works even on the 8-bit AVR MCUs.
