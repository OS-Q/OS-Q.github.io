Unit Testing
============

Unit Testing is a software testing technique that reduces defects in the
newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality.

**PIO Unit Testing** allows you to segregate each part of the firmware/program
and test that the individual parts are working correctly. Using PIO you
can execute the same tests on the local host machine (native), on the multiple
local embedded devices/boards (connected to local host machine), or on both.
When testing both, PIO builds firmware on the host machine, uploads it into
a target device, starts tests and collects the test results into test reports.
The final information will be shown on the host side with informative output
and statistics.

Using :ref:`pioremote` you can start unit tests on the **Remote Device** from
anywhere in the world or integrate with :ref:`ci` systems.
