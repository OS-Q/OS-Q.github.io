Simulators
----------

.. versionadded:: 6.0

Simulation tools and frameworks allow you to simulate hardware systems
and run unit tests in virtual environments. Simulators can significantly
accelerate your project development, especially when used in pair
with :ref:`ci`.

Integration of any simulator tool to the PIO :ref:`unit_testing`
is very simple and does not require any extra software or code writing.
Please use :ref:`projectconf_test_testing_command` project configuration
option and specify a custom command to the simulation program that will
be responsible for the test running. This program must output test
results to the standard output or error stream.

.. note::
  Please note that simulator tools do not require a firmware uploading
  stage. Please use the :option:`pio test --without-uploading` command
  option.

See a few integration examples for the popular simulation tools and
frameworks:
