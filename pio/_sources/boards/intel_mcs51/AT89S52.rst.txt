Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_intel_mcs51`: The Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is an internally Harvard architecture, complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set, single chip microcontroller (uC) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - AT89S52
  * - **Frequency**
    - 11MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 8KB
  * - **RAM**
    - 256B
  * - **Vendor**
    - `Microchip & Atmel <https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/pio/AT89S52?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``AT89S52`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:AT89S52]
  platform = intel_mcs51
  board = AT89S52

You can override default Generic AT89S52 settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `AT89S52.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-intel_mcs51/blob/master/boards/AT89S52.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:AT89S52]
  platform = intel_mcs51
  board = AT89S52

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = at89s52

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 11059200L


Uploading
---------
Generic AT89S52 supports the following uploading protocols:

* ``avrisp``
* ``usbasp``

Default protocol is ``avrdude``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:AT89S52]
  platform = intel_mcs51
  board = AT89S52

  upload_protocol = avrdude

Debugging
---------
:ref:`piodebug` currently does not support Generic AT89S52 board.
