-------------------

.. warning::
    If you use :ref:`pioide`, please enable development version and restart IDE:

    * :ref:`ide_vscode`: Set ``platformio-ide.useDevelopmentPIOCore`` to ``true`` in

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/archive/develop.zip

Or:

.. code-block:: bash

    pio upgrade --dev

To revert to the latest stable version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall platformio
    pip install -U platformio
