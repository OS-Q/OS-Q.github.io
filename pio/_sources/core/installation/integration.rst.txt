Integration with custom applications (extensions, plugins)
----------------------------------------------------------

We recommend using PIO Core **Installer Script** when you integrate PIO Core
into an application, such as an extension or plugin for IDE.

Prerequisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python Interpreter
''''''''''''''''''

PIO Core Installer Script is written in Python and is compatible with Python 2.7+
and Python 3.5+. **We highly recommend using the latest Python 3**.

Python is installed by default on the most popular Unix OS (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD).
If there is no Python on a user machine (you can check running ``python --version``),
we have 2 options:

1. Ask the user to install Python 3 using our guide :ref:`faq_install_python`
2. You can automatically `Download Portable Python 3 (API) <https://api.registry.platformio.org/v3/packages/platformio/tool/python-portable>`_
   and unpack it in a cache folder of your application. Later, you can use
   ``unpacked_protable_python_dir/python.exe`` for the installer script.

Installer Script
''''''''''''''''

There are 2 options on how to work with PIO Core Installer Script:

1. Bundle `get-platformio.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py>`_ file into your application
2. Download `get-platformio.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py>`_ file on demand.

In both cases, you will need to have ``get-platformio.py`` script on the end-user machine.
You can copy or download it to a cache/temporary folder.

A list of arguments and options for the installer script is available via

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py --help

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

We will describe a simple workflow on how to automatically install :ref:`piocore` for
end-user of your application/extension. We assume that ``get-platformio.py`` script
is already copied/downloaded and exists on the end-user machine.
See above for how to get it.

Step 1. Where is PIO Core installed?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You should check the PIO Core installation state **each time** when the user
starts your application. You need to call the Installer Script with ``check core`` arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py check core

This command returns ``0`` "exit code" when PIO Core is already installed
and is ready for use, otherwise, the non-zero code of the subprocess will be
returned and you need to install PIO Core (see **Step #2** below).

If you need to have full information about the PIO Core installation state,
please run with ``--dump-state`` option and specify a folder or a full path where
to save data in JSON format:

.. code-block:: bash

    get-platformio.py check core --dump-state tmpdir/pioinstaller-state.json

Now, read JSON file and use ``platformio_exe`` binary to call PlatforIO Core using CLI
(see :ref:`piocore_userguide`). You can also export ``penv_bin_dir`` into the system
environment ``PATH`` variable and the ``platformio`` command will be available without
a full path.

Example of ``pioinstaller-state.json`` run on macOS:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "cache_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/.cache",
      "core_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio",
      "core_version": "4.3.1",
      "installer_version": "0.2.0",
      "is_develop_core": false,
      "penv_bin_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin",
      "penv_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv",
      "platformio_exe": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio",
      "python_exe": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin/python",
      "system": "darwin_x86_64"
    }

Step 2. Install PIO Core
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To install PIO Core into the virtual environment in an automatic mode, please call
the installer script without any arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py

Available options:

- ``--verbose``, verbose output
- ``--dev``, install the latest development version of PIO Core
- ``--ignore-python``, a path to Python to be ignored (multiple options and Unix wildcards are allowed)

More options are available at ``python get-platformio.py --help``.

Installer Script will return exit code ``0`` on success, otherwise non-zero code and
error explanation.

Next time just use again ``python get-platformio.py check core`` as described in Step #1 (see above).

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Examples that use this installer are:

- `platformio-node-helpers <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-node-helpers>`_,
  is used by `PIO IDE for VSCode <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide>`_
  and `PIO IDE for Atom <https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide>`_
