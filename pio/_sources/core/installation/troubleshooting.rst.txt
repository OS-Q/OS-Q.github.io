Troubleshooting

    **Windows OS**: Please check that you have correctly installed the
    USB driver from the board manufacturer.

If you find any issues with PIO Core Installer Script, please report to

.. _multiple_pio_cores_issue:

Multiple PIO Cores in a system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple standalone :ref:`piocore` in a system could lead to the different
issues. We highly recommend to keep one instance of PIO Core or use built-in
PIO Core in :ref:`pioide`:

* :ref:`ide_atom` - ``Menu PIO: Settings > PIO IDE > Use built-in PIO Core``
* :ref:`ide_vscode` - :ref:`ide_vscode_settings` > Set ``platformio-ide.useBuiltinPIOCore`` to ``true``.

Finally, if you have a standalone :ref:`piocore` in a system, please open system
Terminal (not PIO IDE Terminal) and uninstall obsolete PIO Core:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall platformio

    # if you used macOS "brew"
    brew uninstall platformio

If you need to have :ref:`piocore` globally in a system, please
:ref:`piocore_install_shell_commands`.

'platformio' is not recognized as an internal or external command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use :ref:`pioide`, please check in PIO IDE Settings that
"Use built-in PIO Core" is enabled.

If you modify the system environment variable ``PATH`` in your Bash/Fish/ZSH
profile, please do not override global ``PATH``. This line
``export PATH="/my/custom/path"`` is incorrect. Use ``export PATH="/my/custom/path":$PATH``
instead.

ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows users can experience this issue when multiple Python interpreters are
installed in a system and conflict with each other. The easy way to fix this
problem is uninstalling all Python interpreters using Windows Programs Manager
and installing them manually again.

1. "Windows > Start Menu > Settings > System > Apps & Features", select
   Python interpreters and uninstall them.
2. Install the latest Python interpreter, see :ref:`faq_install_python` guide
3. Remove ``C:\Users\YourUserName\.platformio`` and ``C:\.platformio`` folders
   if exist (do not forget to replace "YourUserName" with the real user name)
4. Restart :ref:`pioide`.
