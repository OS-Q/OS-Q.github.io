Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    pio pkg publish [<source directory, tar.gz or zip>] [OPTIONS]


Description
-----------

Publish a package to the `PIO Registry <https://registry.platformio.org/>`__ so that it can be installed by name.
All files in the package directory are included if ``export`` field is not declared
in a package manifest (for example, see :ref:`manifest_library_json_export`).
The `next items <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/develop/platformio/package/pack.py>`__ are
automatically excluded.

Please check which files will be included in the final package using the
:ref:`cmd_pkg_pack` command.

Once a package is published with a given name and version, that specific name and
version combination can never be used again, even if it is removed with the
:ref:`cmd_pkg_unpublish` command.

If no arguments are supplied, then PIO packs the current package folder.

To list published packages, please use the :ref:`cmd_access_list` command.
