Advanced Serial Monitor with UI
-------------------------------

PIO Core provides CLI version (:ref:`cmd_device_monitor`) of Serial Monitor.
If you need advanced instrument with a rich UI, we recommend free and multi-platform
`CoolTerm <https://freeware.the-meiers.org/?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=docs>`_
serial port terminal application.

.. warning::
  Please note that you need to **manually disconnect (close serial port connection)** in
  CoolTerm **before doing uploading** in PIO. PIO can not disconnect/connect
  to a target device automatically when CoolTerm is used.
