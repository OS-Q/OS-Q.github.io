Custom SCons command-line options
---------------------------------

PIO is built on top of the open-source software construction tool called SCons.
SCons has many useful command-line options that control its behavior and may come in
handy to know the exact internal processes happening in SCons when it builds a target.
For example:

- ``--dry-run`` configures SCons to print the commands that would be executed to build
  any target, but do not execute the commands.
- ``--tree=all`` forces SCons to print file dependency tree including implicit and
  ignored dependencies
- ``--debug=explain`` will print an explanation of why SCons decides to (re-)build the
  targets it selects for building.

The list of available command-line options can be found in the
official `SCons documentation <https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user/ch10.html#sect-command-line-options>`_.

The easiest way to pass extra command-line options to the SCons build system used in
PIO is via the external ``SCONSFLAGS`` environment variable:

.. code-block::

    # POSIX shell
    export SCONSFLAGS="--tree=all"

    # Windows CMD
    C:\Users\foo> set SCONSFLAGS=--dry-run
