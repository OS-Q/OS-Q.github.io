Troubleshooting
---------------

Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _faq_package_manager_error_5:

[Error 5] Access is denied
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PIO installs all packages to ":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/packages"
directory. You **MUST HAVE** write access to this folder.
Please note that **PIO does not require** "sudo"/administrative privileges.

.. contents::
    :local:

Solution 1: Remove folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A quick solution is to remove ":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/packages" folder
and repeat installation/building/uploading again.

Solution 2: Antivirus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some antivirus tools forbid programs to create files in the background.
PIO Package Manager does all work in the background: downloads package,
unpacks archive in temporary folder and moves final files to
":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/packages" folder.

Antivirus tool can block PIO, that is why you see "[Error 5] Access is denied".
Try to **disable it for a while** or add :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`
directory to exclusion/whitelist.

Solution 3: Run from Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we mentioned in "Solution 2", antivirus tools can block background file
system operations. Another solution is to run :ref:`piocore` from a system terminal.

1. Open **System Terminal**, on Windows ``cmd.exe`` (not :ref:`pioide` Terminal)
2. Build a project and upload firmware using :ref:`piocore` which will download
   and install all dependent packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Change directory to PIO Project where is located "platformio.ini"
       cd path/to/platformio/project

       # Force PIO to install PIO Home dependencies
       pio home

       # Force PIO to install toolchains
       pio run --target upload

If "pio" command is not globally available in your environment and you
use :ref:`pioide`, please use built-in :ref:`piocore` which is located in:

* Windows: ``C:\Users\{username}\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio``
  Please replace ``{username}`` with a real user name
* Unix: ``~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio``


.. note::
    You can add ``platformio`` and ``pio`` commands to your system environment.
    See :ref:`piocore_install_shell_commands`.

Building

UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Full warning message is "UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to
convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal".

**KNOWN ISSUE**. Please move your project to a folder which full path does not
contain non-ASCII chars.

UnicodeDecodeError: Non-ASCII characters found in build environment
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**KNOWN ISSUE**. :ref:`piocore` currently does not support projects which
contain non-ASCII characters (codes) in a full path or depend on the
libraries which use non-ASCII characters in their names.

**TEMPORARY SOLUTION**

1. Use :ref:`pioide`, it will automatically install :ref:`piocore` in a root
   of system disk (``%DISK%/.platformio``) and avoid an issue when system
   User contains non-ASCII characters
2. Do not use non-ASCII characters in project folder name or its parent folders.

Also, if you want to place :ref:`piocore` in own location, see:

* Set :envvar:`PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR` environment variable with own path
* Configure custom location per project using :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`
  option in :ref:`projectconf`.
