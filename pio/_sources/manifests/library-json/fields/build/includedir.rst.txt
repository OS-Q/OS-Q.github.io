``includeDir``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional* | Type: ``String``

Custom directory to be searched for header files.
A default value is ``include`` and means that folder is located at
the root of a library.

.. note::
    The :ref:`ldf` will pick a library automatically only when
    a project or other dependent libraries include any header file
    located in ``includeDir`` or ``srcDir``.
