.. _manifest_library_json_build_libArchive:

``libArchive``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional* | Type: ``Boolean``

Create an archive (``*.a``, static library) from the object files and link it
into a firmware (program). This is default behavior of PIO Build System
(``"libArchive": true``).

Setting ``"libArchive": false`` will instruct PIO Build System to link object
files directly (in-line). This could be useful if you need to override ``weak``
symbols defined in framework or other libraries.

You can disable library archiving globally using :ref:`projectconf_lib_archive`
option in :ref:`projectconf`.
