``platforms``
-------------

*Optional* | Type: ``String`` or ``Array``

A list with compatible development platforms. The available platform name are defined
in :ref:`platforms` section.

**Example**

.. code-block:: javascript

    "platforms": ["atmelavr", "espressif8266"]

If the library is compatible with the all platforms, then do not declare this field or
use ``*`` symbol:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "platforms": "*"

.. note::
    PIO does not check platforms for compatibility in default mode.
    See :ref:`ldf_compat_mode` for details. If you need a strict checking for compatible
    platforms for a library, please set :ref:`manifest_library_json_build_libCompatMode` to ``strict``.
