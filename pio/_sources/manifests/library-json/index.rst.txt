library.json
============

``library.json`` is a manifest file of a library package. It allows developers
to keep a project in its own structure and define:

* compatible frameworks and platforms
* external dependencies
* advanced build settings.

Information in ``library.json`` should be represented in `JSON-style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_
via `associative array <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array>`_
(name/value pairs). The order doesn't matter. The allowable fields
(names from pairs) are described below.

You can validate ``library.json`` manifest file using the :ref:`cmd_pkg_pack` command
or :ref:`manifest_library_json_schema`.
