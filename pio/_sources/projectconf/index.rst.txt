"platformio.ini" (Project Configuration File)
=============================================

``platformio.ini`` is a configuration file that lets you set up your development
environment, share your code and configurations with others, and leverage a
declarative approach to development. You can use ``platformio.ini`` to
configure multiple platforms and architectures without having to worry
about different toolchains or build systems for each one.

Each PIO project has its own ``platformio.ini`` that
is located in the root directory of the project. This is an
`INI-style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ file.
``platformio.ini`` has sections (each denoted by a ``[header]``) and
key/value pairs within the sections. Lines beginning with ``;``
are ignored and may be used to provide comments.

Multiple value options can be specified in two ways:

1. Split values with ", " (comma + space)
2. Multi-line format, where each new line starts with at least two spaces.

Here are the allowed sections and their allowed contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    sections/platformio/index
    sections/env/index
    interpolation
    examples

**Example**

For more examples, see :ref:`official project examples and community projects <tutorials>`.
