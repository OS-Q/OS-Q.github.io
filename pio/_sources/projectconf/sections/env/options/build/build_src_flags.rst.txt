.. _projectconf_build_src_flags:

``build_src_flags``
-------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

An option ``build_src_flags`` has the same behavior as ``build_flags``
but will be applied only for the project source files in the
:ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir` directory.

This option can also be set by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_SRC_FLAGS`.
