.. _projectconf_targets:

``targets``
-----------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

A list of targets which will be processed by the :ref:`cmd_run` command by
default. You can enter more than one target, if separated by comma+space **", "**.

Please follow to :option:`pio run --list-targets` documentation for the other
targets.

**Examples**

1. Build a project using :ref:`Release Configuration <build_configurations>`,
   upload the firmware, and start :ref:`Serial Monitor <cmd_device_monitor>`
   automatically:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [env:upload_and_monitor]
       targets = upload, monitor

2. Build a project using :ref:`Debug Configuration <build_configurations>`.


**Tip!** You can use these targets like an option to
:option:`pio run --target` command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # clean project
    pio run -t clean

    # dump current build environment
    pio run --target envdump

When no targets are defined, *PIO* will build only sources by default.
