.. _projectconf_check_patterns:

``check_patterns``
------------------

Type: ``String (Pattern)`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

This option allows specifying which source files or folders should be
included/excluded from the check process. `GLOB Patterns <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ are allowed.
:ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir` and :ref:`projectconf_pio_include_dir` folders are checked
by default.

Another option for filtering source files is :option:`pio check --pattern` command.

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:custom_check_patterns]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    check_tool = clangtidy
    check_patterns =
      app/sources
      tests/hardware/*.c
