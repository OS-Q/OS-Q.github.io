.. _projectconf_check_skip_packages:

``check_skip_packages``
-----------------------

Type: ``Bool (yes or no)`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ``no``

Exclude underlying third-party packages from the checking process. By default, PIO
passes frameworks and toolchains include paths required by internal analysis tools to
properly analyze project sources. Some of the supported analysis tools use their own
preprocessor which may fail to parse perfectly valid code and thus provide empty or
partial check reports. This option is useful when developers have no control over this
third-party code and want to perform analysis at least on project sources.

Another option for excluding third-party packages is :option:`pio check --skip-packages`
command.

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:extra_check_flags]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    check_tool = cppcheck, clangtidy
    check_skip_packages = yes
