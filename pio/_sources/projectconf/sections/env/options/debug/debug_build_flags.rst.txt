.. _projectconf_debug_build_flags:

``debug_build_flags``
---------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes`` | Default: ``-Og -g2 -ggdb2``

These flags/options affect the preprocessing, compilation, assembly
and linking processes for C and C++ code.

.. note::
  This option might be helpful to adjust the optimization level if firmware with
  debug information is too big to be uploaded to a target

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:debug]
    platform = ...
    board = ...

    ; Set optimization level and amount of debug information generated by the compiler
    debug_build_flags = -O0 -ggdb3 -g3

`Other possible flags  <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html>`__
that might be useful for debugging your application.
