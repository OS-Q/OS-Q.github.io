.. _projectconf_debug_extra_cmds:

``debug_extra_cmds``
--------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

Extra commands that will be passed to back-end debugger after :ref:`projectconf_debug_init_cmds`.
For example, add custom breakpoint and load ``.gdbinit`` from a project directory
for GDB:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:debug]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_extra_cmds =
      break main.cpp:13
      break foo.cpp:100
      source .gdbinit

.. note::

  **Initial Project Breakpoints**: Use ``break path/to/file:LINE_NUMBER`` to
  define initial breakpoints for debug environment. Multiple breakpoints are
  allowed.

  To save session breakpoints, please use ``save breakpoints [filename]``
  command in Debug Console. For example, ``save breakpoints .gdbinit``. Later,
  this file could be loaded via ``source [filename]`` command. See above.
