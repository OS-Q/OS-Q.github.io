``debug_init_cmds``
-------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes`` | Default: `See details... <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/tree/develop/platformio/debug/config>`__

Initial commands that will be passed to back-end debugger.

PIO dynamically configures back-end debugger depending on a debug
environment. Here is `a list with default initial commands <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/develop/platformio/commands/debug/initcfgs.py>`__
for the popular :ref:`debugging_tools`.

For example, the custom initial commands for GDB:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:debug]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_init_cmds =
      target extended-remote $DEBUG_PORT
      $INIT_BREAK
      monitor reset halt
      $LOAD_CMDS
      monitor init
      monitor reset halt
