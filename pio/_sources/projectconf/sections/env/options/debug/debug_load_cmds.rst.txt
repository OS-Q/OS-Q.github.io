.. _projectconf_debug_load_cmds:

``debug_load_cmds``
-------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes`` | Default: ``load``

Specify a command which will be used to load program/firmware to a target
device. Possible options:

* ``load`` - **default** option
* ``load [address]`` - load program at specified address, where "[address]"
  should be a valid number
* ``preload`` - some embedded devices have locked Flash Memory (a few
  Freescale Kinetis and NXP LPC boards). In this case, firmware loading using
  debugging client is disabled. ``preload`` command instructs
  :ref:`piocore` to load program/firmware using development platform "upload"
  method (via bootloader, media disk, etc)
* (empty value, ``debug_load_cmds =``), disables program loading at all.
* ``custom commands`` - pass any debugging client command (GDB, etc.)

Sometimes you need to run extra monitor commands (on debug server side) before
program/firmware loading, such as flash unlocking or erasing. In this case we
can combine service commands with loading and run them before. See example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:debug]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_load_cmds =
      monitor flash erase_sector 0 0 11
      load
