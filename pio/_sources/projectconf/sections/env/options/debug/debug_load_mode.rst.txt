.. _projectconf_debug_load_mode:

``debug_load_mode``
-------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ``always``

Allows one to control when PIO should load debugging firmware to the end
target. Possible options:

* ``always`` - load for the each debugging session, **default**
* ``modified`` - load only when firmware was modified
* ``manual`` - do not load firmware automatically. You are responsible to
  pre-flash target with debugging firmware in this case.
