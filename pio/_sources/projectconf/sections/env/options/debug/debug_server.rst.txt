.. _projectconf_debug_server:

``debug_server``
----------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiline Arguments: ``Yes``

Allows one to setup a custom debugging server. By default, boards are pre-configured
with a debugging server that is compatible with "on-board" debugging tool
(adapter, probe). Also, this option is useful for a
:ref:`debugging_tool_custom` debugging tool.

**Option format (multi-line)**:

* First line is an executable path of debugging server
* 2-nd and the next lines are arguments for executable file

**Examples:**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:debug]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_server =
      /path/to/debugging/server
      arg1
      arg2
      ...
      argN

    [env:debug_openocd]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = custom
    debug_server =
        ${platformio.packages_dir}/tool-openocd/openocd
        -f
        ${platformio.packages_dir}/tool-openocd/scripts/board/stm32f103zet6_warship.cfg
