.. _projectconf_debug_speed:

``debug_speed``
---------------

Type: ``Number | String`` | Multiple: ``No``

The debug adapter speed. The value format depends on the type of :ref:`debugging_tools`.

.. note::
  Please note that this option takes effect only if :ref:`platforms` implement it.

Examples:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:custom_debug_speed_examples]
    ...

    ; fixed speed in kHz
    debug_speed = 500

    ; automatic speed (only J-Link)
    debug_speed = auto

    ; adaptive clocking instead of fixed JTAG speed (only J-Link)
    debug_speed = adaptive
