.. _projectconf_lib_archive:

``lib_archive``
---------------

Type: ``Bool (yes or no)`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ``yes``

Create an archive (``*.a``, static library) from the object files and link it
into a firmware (program). This is default behavior of PIO Build System
(``lib_archive = yes``).

Setting ``lib_archive = no`` will instruct PIO Build System to link object
files directly (in-line). This could be useful if you need to override ``weak``
symbols defined in framework or other libraries.

You can disable library archiving per a custom library using
:ref:`manifest_library_json_build_libArchive` field in :ref:`library_json` manifest.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    lib_archive = no
