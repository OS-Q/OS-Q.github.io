.. _projectconf_lib_compat_mode:

``lib_compat_mode``
-------------------

.. seealso::
    Please make sure to read :ref:`ldf` guide first.

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ``soft``

Library compatibility mode allows one to control strictness of Library Dependency
Finder. See :ref:`ldf_compat_mode` for details and available options..

By default, this value is set to ``lib_compat_mode = soft`` and means that LDF
will check only for framework compatibility.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    ; Checks for the compatibility with frameworks and dev/platforms
    lib_compat_mode = strict
