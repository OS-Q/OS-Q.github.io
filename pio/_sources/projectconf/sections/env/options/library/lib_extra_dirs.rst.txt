.. _projectconf_lib_extra_dirs:

``lib_extra_dirs``
------------------

.. seealso::
    Please make sure to read :ref:`ldf` guide first.

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

A list with extra directories/storages where :ref:`ldf` will
look for dependencies.

This option can also be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_LIB_EXTRA_DIRS`.

.. warning::
  This is a not direct path to a library with source code. It should be a path
  to storage that contains libraries grouped by folders. For example,
  ``D:\PIO\extra\libraries`` but not ``D:\PIO\extra\libraries\FooLibrary``.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    lib_extra_dirs =
        /common/libraries
        /iot/libraries
