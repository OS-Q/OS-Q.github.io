.. _projectconf_board_build.f_cpu:

``board_build.f_cpu``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``Number`` | Multiple: ``No``

The option ``board_build.f_cpu`` is used to define MCU frequency (Hertz, Clock). A
format of this option is ``C-like long integer`` value with ``L`` suffix. The
1 Hertz is equal to ``1L``, then 16 MHz (Mega Hertz) is equal to ``16000000L``.

The full list of ``board_build.f_cpu`` for the popular embedded platforms you can
find in *Boards* section of :ref:`platforms`. See "Frequency" column.

.. note::
    This option doesn't make any changes to real clock settings on hardware. You should
    specify a ``board_build.f_cpu`` value  if you have changed a target's clock frequency
    so that the underlying software will be configured accordingly to match the change.
