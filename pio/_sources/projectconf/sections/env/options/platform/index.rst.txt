More options
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can override any board option declared in manifest file using the next
format ``board_{OBJECT.PATH}``, where ``{OBJECT.PATH}`` is an object path in
JSON manifest. Please navigate to "boards" folder of `PlatfomIO development platforms <https://github.com/topics/platformio-platform>`_
and open JSON file to list all available options.

For example, `Manifest: Espressif ESP32 Dev Module <https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/blob/develop/boards/esp32dev.json>`_:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:custom_board_options]
    ; Custom CPU Frequency
    board_build.f_cpu = 160000000L

    ; Custom FLASH Frequency
    board_build.f_flash = 80000000L

    ; Custom FLASH Mode
    board_build.flash_mode = qio

    ; Custom linker script
    board_build.ldscript = /path/to/ldscript.ld

    ; Custom maximum program size
    board_upload.maximum_size = 1310720
