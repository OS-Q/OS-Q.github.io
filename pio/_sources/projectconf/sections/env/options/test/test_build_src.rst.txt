.. _projectconf_test_build_src:

``test_build_src``
------------------

Type: ``Bool (yes or no)`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ``no``

Setting ``test_build_src`` to ``yes`` will force :ref:`unit_testing` engine
to build the main source code from :ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir` in pair
with a test code. See :ref:`unit_testing_shared_code` for details.

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = ...
  test_build_src = yes
