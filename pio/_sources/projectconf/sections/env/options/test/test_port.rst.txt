.. _projectconf_test_port:

``test_port``
-------------

Type: ``String (Pattern)`` | Multiple: ``No``

This option specifies communication interface between PIO
:ref:`unit_testing` Test Runner and the target device. The possible
values are the same as documented for :ref:`projectconf_monitor_port`
option.

If ``test_port`` isn't specified, the PIO :ref:`unit_testing`
runner will try to detect it automatically.

To print all available serial ports use the :ref:`cmd_device_list` command.
