.. _projectconf_test_testing_command:

``test_testing_command``
------------------------

Type: ``String`` | Multiline Arguments: ``Yes``

A custom testing command that executes test cases and returns results
to the standard output.

Typically, a default value for the :ref:`platform_native` is equal
to:

.. code:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = native
  test_testing_command =
    ${platformio.build_dir}/${this.__env__}/program

You can override the default command and pass extra program arguments:

.. code:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = native
  test_testing_command =
    ${platformio.build_dir}/${this.__env__}/program
    arg1
    --option2
    option2_value

Please note that you can pass extra arguments to the program
using CLI and :option:`pio test --program-arg` option.

See :ref:`unit_testing_simulators` examples.
