.. _projectconf_upload_port:

``upload_port``
---------------

Type: ``String (Pattern)`` | Multiple: ``No``

This option is used by "uploader" tool when sending firmware to board via
``upload_port``. For example,

* ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` - Serial port (Unix-based OS)
* ``COM3`` - Serial port (Windows OS)
* ``192.168.0.13`` - IP address when using OTA
* ``/media/disk`` - physical path to media disk/flash drive
  (:ref:`framework_mbed` enabled boards)
* ``D:`` - physical path to media disk/flash drive (Windows OS).

If ``upload_port`` isn't specified, then *PIO* will try to detect it
automatically.

To print all available serial ports please use :ref:`cmd_device_list` command.

This option can also be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_PORT`.

Please note that you can use patterns:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Pattern
      - Meaning

    * - ``*``
      - matches everything

    * - ``?``
      - matches any single character

    * - ``[seq]``
      - matches any character in seq

    * - ``[!seq]``
      - matches any character not in seq

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    framework = arduino
    ; any port that starts with /dev/ttyUSB
    upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB*

    ; COM1 or COM3
    upload_port = COM[13]
