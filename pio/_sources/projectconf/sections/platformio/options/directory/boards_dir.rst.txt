.. _projectconf_pio_boards_dir:

``boards_dir``
--------------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: "<Project>/``boards``"

The location of project-specific board definitions. Each project may
choose a suitable directory name.  The default value is ``boards``,
meaning a "boards" directory located in the root of the project.

By default, PIO looks for boards in this order:

1. Project :ref:`projectconf_pio_boards_dir` (as defined by this setting)
2. Global :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/boards
3. Development platform :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/platforms/\*/boards.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BOARDS_DIR`.
