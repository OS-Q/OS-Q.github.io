.. _projectconf_pio_build_dir:

``build_dir``
-------------

.. warning::
    **PLEASE DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS FOLDER**. PIO will overwrite
    your changes on the next build. **THIS IS A CACHE DIRECTORY**.

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ":ref:`projectconf_pio_workspace_dir`/build"

*PIO Build System* uses this folder for project
environments to store compiled object files, static libraries, firmwares and
other cached information. It allows PIO to build source code extremely
fast!

*You can delete this folder without any risk!* If you modify :ref:`projectconf`,
then PIO will remove this folder automatically. It will be created on the
next build operation.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR`.

.. note::
    If you have any problems with building your project environments which
    are defined in :ref:`projectconf`, then **TRY TO DELETE** this folder. In
    this situation you will remove all cached files without any risk. Also,
    you can use "clean" target for :option:`pio run --target` command.
