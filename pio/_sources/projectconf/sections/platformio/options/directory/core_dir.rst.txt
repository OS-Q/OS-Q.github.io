.. _projectconf_pio_core_dir:

``core_dir``
------------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No``

The core_dir variable points out the directory used for all
development platform packages (toolchains, frameworks, SDKs, upload
and debug tools), global libraries for :ref:`ldf`, and other
PIO Core service data. The size of this folder will depend on
the number of installed development platforms.

The default value is the user's home directory:

* Unix ``~/.platformio``
* Windows ``%HOMEPATH%\.platformio``

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR`.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [platformio]
    core_dir = /path/to/custom/pio-core/storage
