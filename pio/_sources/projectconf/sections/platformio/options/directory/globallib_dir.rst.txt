.. _projectconf_pio_globallib_dir:

``globallib_dir``
-----------------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: ":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/lib" | **DEPRECATED**

.. warning::
    This option is **DEPRECATED**. We do not recommend using global libraries for
    new projects. Please use a declarative approach for the safety-critical embedded
    development and declare project dependencies using the :ref:`projectconf_lib_deps` option.

Global library storage for PlatfrmIO projects and :ref:`librarymanager` where
:ref:`ldf` looks for dependencies.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_GLOBALLIB_DIR`.
