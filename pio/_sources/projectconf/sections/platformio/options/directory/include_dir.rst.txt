.. _projectconf_pio_include_dir:

``include_dir``
---------------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: "<Project>/``include``"

The path to project's default header files. PIO uses it for the
:ref:`cmd_run` command. The default value is ``include`` meaning an
``include`` directory located under the root directory of the project. This
path will be added to ``CPPPATH`` of the build environment.

If you need to add extra include directories to ``CPPPATH`` scope, please use
:ref:`projectconf_build_flags` with ``-I /path/to/extra/dir`` option.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_INCLUDE_DIR`.
