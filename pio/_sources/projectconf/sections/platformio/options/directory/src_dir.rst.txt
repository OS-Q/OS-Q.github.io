.. _projectconf_pio_src_dir:

``src_dir``
-----------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: "<Project>/``src``"

The path to the project's directory with source code. PIO uses
it for the :ref:`cmd_run` command. The default value is ``src``
meaning a ``src`` directory located in the root directory of the project.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SRC_DIR`.

.. note::
    This option is useful for people who migrate from Arduino IDE where
    the source directory should have the same name as the main source file.
    See `example <https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelavr/tree/develop/examples/arduino-own-src_dir>`__ project with own source directory.
