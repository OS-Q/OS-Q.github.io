.. _projectconf_pio_default_envs:

``default_envs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

The :ref:`cmd_run` command processes all environments ``[env:***]`` by default
if the :option:`pio run --environment` option is not specified.
:ref:`projectconf_pio_default_envs` allows one to define which environments that
should be processed by default.

Also, :ref:`piodebug` checks this option when looking for debug environment.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_DEFAULT_ENVS`.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [platformio]
    default_envs = uno, nodemcu

    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    framework = arduino
    board = uno

    [env:nodemcu]
    platform = espressif8266
    framework = arduino
    board = nodemcu

    [env:teensy31]
    platform = teensy
    framework = arduino
    board = teensy31

    [env:lpmsp430g2553]
    platform = timsp430
    framework = arduino
    board = lpmsp430g2553
    build_flags = -D LED_BUILTIN=RED_LED
