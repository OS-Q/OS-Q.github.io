Build external sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your project depends on some arbitrary source files that are located outside of the
usual source directory :ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir` then you can use a preliminary
extra script to add them to the build process. A typical situation when this approach
may be useful is when a project depends on pregenerated files in a temporary folder.
Here is a typical configuration with an extra_script that instructs PIO to build
all sources in an external folder:

``platformio.ini``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:my_env]
    platform = ...
    extra_scripts = pre:extra_script.py

``extra_script.py`` (place it near ``platformio.ini``):

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    Import("env")

    env.BuildSources(
        os.path.join("$BUILD_DIR", "external", "build"),
        os.path.join("$PROJECT_DIR", "external", "sources")
    )
