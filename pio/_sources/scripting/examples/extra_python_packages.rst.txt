Extra Python packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your project or library depends on the extra Python packages, you can use extra script to
install them into the same virtual environment where :ref:`piocore` is installed.

``platformio.ini``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:my_env]
    platform = ...
    extra_scripts = extra_script.py

``extra_script.py`` (place it near ``platformio.ini``):

.. code-block:: python

    Import("env")

    # List installed packages
    env.Execute("$PYTHONEXE -m pip list")

    # Install custom packages from the PyPi registry
    env.Execute("$PYTHONEXE -m pip install pkg1 pkg2")

    # Install missed package
    try:
    	import some_package
    except ImportError:
    	env.Execute("$PYTHONEXE -m pip install some_package")
