Advanced Scripting
==================

.. warning::
  Advanced Scripting is recommended for Advanced Users and requires
  knowledge of the Python language.

The PIO Build System allows the user to extend the build process with
custom scripts using the Python interpreter and
the `SCons <http://www.scons.org>`_ construction tool.
Build flags, upload flags, targets, toolchains data and other information are
available for modification as `SCons Construction Environments <http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-environments>`_.
Custom scripts are included with :ref:`projectconf_extra_scripts`.

.. warning::
  Please note that you can not run or debug these scripts independently
  with Python interpreter. They will be loaded automatically when the
  :ref:`cmd_run` command processes the project environment.
